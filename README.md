# Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
 * First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the tutor.

       * Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a image with Text and a "Book a lesson" Call to action button which will redirect to contact page.

       ![](?raw=true)
       
       * Next there are the subjects I teach with a Call to action button which will redirects to learn more about the tutor.

       ![](?raw=true)

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        * The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.

        * At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure      the  user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
            
        * On the Contact Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

        ![](?raw=true)
        
        ![](?raw=true)

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

        * Once the new visitor has read the About page and What I Do text, they will notice the qualification and use of online service.

        * The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.

        * At the bottom of the Contact page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the person on social media which highlights the links to them.

        ![](?raw=true)



 *  Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added reviews about the tutor.

       * The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily check the reviews section.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new subjects are added.

       * The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily check the subjects.

# Further Testing
* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
# Known Bugs
* Hover effects don't work on the navigation bar
  * I tried fixing hover effects on a nav bar but somehow Bootstrap is overriding the CSS. Since there is not much impact on the UX and there are clear redirection provided I left it unfixed

# Credits
## Code
* [Bootstrap 5.0:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) Bootstrap was used significantly throughout the project to make it responsive. I used the Grid system as well as inputting a fixed-top navbar, a progress bar and contact form.

* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) was used to help me style the navbar text colour and was used in HTML to close the navbar when a link is clicked on mobile.

* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) was used to provide a smooth scroll to the website and to style the contact form and the submit button.

* [Courses.Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/ci_program/level5diplomainwebappdevelopment) was used to style the progress bars and I used the demonstrated jQuery for the contact form.
